Clock solver for FFXIII-2 puzzles

Once upon a TIME I was playing FF13-2 and decided I didn't want to be a human Turing machine for entertainment purposes, but instead I'd hurry back to getting cheesed by ridiculous cheevo requirements, so instead I would let a computer work a computer problem and wrote this up.

The input is a comma-separated list of the numbers on the digits, clockwise from any starting point. The output is the order to visit the faces to solve the puzzle.

This is like that one guy at the Wildlands in 13-3 who gets Claire to give him the requirements for the hunter group. Speaking of which, would you rather be partying in the Wildlands or wilding in the Partylands?

RIP Origa the only moment is now
